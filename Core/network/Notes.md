# Networking
- Networking refers to how connected computers communicate. This can be done over internet or private network. 
  Private network also referd as intranet.
- Networking enables exchange of data between application and users.
- It is a foundation of internet, distrubutred and cloud computing.


## Terminology
- Client & Server
    - One or more host on the network are acting as a server and other host that are client connect to 
    that server.
    - Client are the end-users devices or application, that request services or resources from the server.
    - Server usealy are computers or applications, that provide services or resources to the clients.
    They listen for the incoming requests from client, process them and provide appropriate response.
- Port
    - Port is the interface of application or computer which receives the data coming from physical network.
    - In other words, application which intended to receive the data should have port assigned to it. When data
    comes, this port is used to route the data to the application, which is waiting for it.
    - Port number is positive integer between 0 to 65535
- IP Address
    - IP stand for Internet Protocol
    - This describe the destination on the network, where data suppose to go. That is done using IP address.
    - So each machines connected to internet OR even on private network has IP address, which enable communication possible.
- TCP & UDP
    - There are the commonly used protocols used by computers systems to communicate with each other.
    - TCP is connection oriented. It creates and maintains the connection. It guaranties that data will 
    be delivered and will wait for confirmation response from client.
    - UDP is connection less. It does not guaranty data delivery and does not wait for response for client.
- TCP IP
    - It describe network and data trasfer protocol.
    - It uses TCP to trasfer data over the network of computers having IP address.
